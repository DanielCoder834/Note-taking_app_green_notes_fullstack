# green_notes_fullstack
 
This is a project where I made a full-stack note-taking application. Currently, the project is not online as there are some security issues I would need to extensively take care of. Primarily, detering HTML injection, and XSS attacks, which I am unfamilar with at the moment. (I will to try to find a library to help with this in the future).
